		<p>Amazing, like such a good good game. I loved everything about it—the music, the audio design, the narrative, the gameplay mechanics, the characters, the voice acting—everything was so well done. The passion the devs put into this project is so evident, which is such a breath of fresh air from the soulless work that some developers put out just for the sake of putting it out.</p> <p>Went into this game completely blind, as should you if you’re getting into it. The only prior knowledge I had was that MoistCritikal was part of the project, which was obviously a huge selling point for me. After getting into the game, Aaron Taylor Paul’s performance was actually so phenomenal—he deserved a GOTY nomination for voice acting at the very least. The main character, Robert Robertson, is so well written and honestly one of my favourite lead protags of all time. The choices and dialogue felt natural without seeming too random or just there for the sake of being there. Obviously, the most important choice of who you pick as your love interest—which there’s an obvious answer to, btw—divided the community into two halves. Character arcs and building them to the point you care about them is a serious task, and one this game manages to execute really well.</p> <p>Sound design is amazing, with the sound effects and the background scores, and scenes paired with the music—especially the bar fight sequence (*chef’s kiss*)—are super cool. The community has mixed feelings on the dispatch mechanic, but me personally, I loved it. It was super fun trying to send the perfect heroes for the correct calls, and it’s a super unique and cool mechanic that could defo be expanded upon.</p> <p>Huge props to AdHoc Studio and the team for their work on this game—hoping for a season 2, fingers crossed. Honestly, I could go on and on, but the basic gist is: favourite game of the year. Go for it if you’re into visual novels or looking for a game with a thrilling story. Also, check out all the songs in this game—they’re so peak, I swear (Radio and Capsize have my heart). <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/235R9D3UGiinOpb0Rw2mtQ?si=4a9a1cbb71a94c76" 				target = "_blank">Dispatch album</a></p>

				<p>Spectacular sequel and honestly such a massive improvement over its predecessor in almost every way. The map is incredible, the world feels huge and alive, 				and the atmosphere and lore are just top tier. Gondor is genuinely beautiful, from the environments to the way the regions feel distinct and lived in. The 				sound design is fantastic too, from the clashing steel to the ambient sounds in the world—it all adds so much to the immersion.</p> <p>The absolute standout 				of this game is obviously the Nemesis system, and man, it is just insanely fun. The amount of personality, randomness, and emergent storytelling it creates 				is unreal. No two playthroughs ever feel the same, and every orc encounter can turn into its own mini story. I spent literal hours just messing around with 				it—trying to recruit everyone in a specific location, turning enemies into allies, watching rivalries form, betrayals happen (bruz you didnt have to do me 				like that :/ ) , and seeing captains come back stronger after killing me. It’s such a shame that the Nemesis system is patented because it’s genuinely one 				of the most fun and innovative mechanics in gaming, and it deserves to be used and evolved more.</p> <p>The gameplay loop is super addictive and massively 				improved compared to the previous game. Combat feels smoother, abilities feel more impactful, and fighting the chief masters is always a blast. Each one 				feels like its own challenge, and taking them down never gets old. The replayability is insane because of how dynamic everything feels, especially with the 				Nemesis system constantly shaking things up.</p> <p>I was heavily invested in this game. I got 100% in game did pretty much everything—completing all the 				side quests, conquering every region, unlocking pretty much everything, and collecting everything there was to collect. The game just pulls you in and keeps 				you there. Between the lore, the atmosphere, the combat, and the sheer fun of the systems at play, it’s incredibly easy to lose hours without even realizing 				it.</p> <p>Overall, an absolutely fantastic experience with amazing world-building, insanely fun mechanics, a power trip and ridiculous replay value. One of 				those games where you start playing “for a bit” and suddenly it’s been hours.</p>

<p>Marvelous game with an amazing music score and a really strong, heavy plot. The choices actually feel meaningful, and the complexity of how the story branches out is genuinely impressive. You can really feel the weight of your decisions, and knowing that small choices can massively change outcomes makes every moment feel tense. The deviant conflict is super interesting and easily one of the strongest parts of the game.</p> <p>Connor and Kara were easily my favourite characters. Connor especially stood out, and his relationship with Hank was honestly the main push for me throughout the game. Deciding whether my Connor should become a deviant or not was an actual choice I had to sit and think about. I didn’t really see my Connor becoming a deviant fitting his character, but at the same time, I wanted him to keep that human connection with Hank. That internal conflict made his storyline so compelling, and Connor–Hank is easily the best relationship in the game.</p> <p>The game also looks insane. The graphical fidelity is incredible, from the character models to the facial animations and environments—it still holds up extremely well. Everything feels cinematic, and it really helps sell the emotional moments.</p> <p>Kara’s story was also really strong, but Alice being revealed as a deviant felt unnecessary to me. I feel like it would’ve been way more impactful if she stayed human, especially for building the whole human and AI coexisting theme. Markus and his father was a really good storyline as well, and that dynamic worked well emotionally.</p> <p>That said, Markus himself wasn’t as interesting to me as Kara or Connor. He’s still serviceable as a character, but he didn’t hit the same highs. The Markus and North love plot felt unnecessary and not built enough, and it didn’t really have any emotional impact. It kind of just happened, and it didn’t match my Markus at all. My Markus was a complete pacifist who went against pretty much everything North wanted, and she still ends up falling for him, which was honestly kinda funny.</p> <p>I finished the game with the deviants getting their freedom and pretty much everyone surviving, including Kara, so I was really happy with how it all ended. Overall, a fantastic experience with great music, strong storytelling, meaningful choices, and a current-day relevant topic as well. Pick it up if you’re into heavy story visual novels.</p>

			<p>This game was honestly such a pleasant surprise. I went into this game completely blind and didn’t expect nearly this much depth from what I thought was just a simple 2D platformer. The aesthetic and visual beauty of the game are incredible, and the pixel art style paired with the music creates such a cozy but emotional atmosphere. The level design is really strong and always feels purposeful, never unfair, just challenging in the right ways.</p> <p>The story is surprisingly compelling and does such a good job tackling mental health, self-doubt, and the idea of climbing that mountain to prove your worth to yourself. The dynamic between Madeline and Badeline is really well done and feels meaningful rather than gimmicky. It adds emotional weight to the gameplay and makes the climb feel personal instead of just another platforming challenge.</p> <p>This is actually the first game where I actively tried to go for 100% achievements. I’m currently about 90% of the way there, having completed all the B-sides except one. The game is definitely very difficult at first, but once you get the mechanics down, it becomes insanely rewarding. Pulling off stuff later that you could only dream of doing at the start feels amazing and really shows how much you’ve improved.I've died nearly 1000+ times per level and this is fact cause theres a counter for your deaths trying to get all the strawberries and the b-sides are no joke.I have'nt reached the C-sides yet but i assume there's going to be a lot of shaking my fists in the air trying not to break something.</p> <p>The 1-Up achievement was super annoying to get, but I eventually got it, and it felt so good when I finally did. I’ve got four achievements left now, and I’m really looking forward to getting that 100%.</p>

<p>Cyberpunk 2077—what a game, dude. Firstly, I have to address the elephant in the room, that being the game’s initial launch state, which was pretty bad. Although at the time I didn’t have a system that could run it, I saw gameplay and everyone was heavy on the criticism, but I still liked the aesthetic and really wanted to play it. This year I finally did, and what an experience it was.</p> <p>Night City is so, so beautiful. The map doesn’t feel empty at all, and it’s so nice to drive around that I rarely used the fast travel feature. The driving in this game feels pretty good, especially motorbikes in first person with the radio on—it’s just such a vibe.</p> <p>Obviously, I spent like my first two hours of the game on the character creation screen, and this game definitely has one of my favourite character creation systems, trailing just behind Monster Hunter creation screens. The fashion in this game is great, with tons of options, and obviously the cyberpunk setting just adds an insane cool factor.</p> <p>Cyberware is one of the coolest parts of the game and really makes you feel like you’re building your own version of V. Upgrading your body with different cyberware completely changes how you play, whether that’s slowing down time, moving faster, hacking enemies, or turning yourself into a full-on walking weapon. The perk tree is also super satisfying to invest in, with so many viable builds that actually feel distinct from each other. Putting points into skills and slowly seeing your character become stronger and more specialized feels really rewarding.</p> <p>The weapons in this game are also a lot of fun to use. There’s a great variety, and each playstyle feels supported, whether you’re going all-in on guns, blades, stealth, or hacking. Combat feels punchy and stylish, and experimenting with different weapons alongside your cyberware abilities makes encounters feel fresh even hours in.</p> <p>Johnny Silverhand ended up being my favourite character—he’s super well written and genuinely complex, and I really warmed up to him over time, which is pretty evident considering I went for the Temperance ending.</p> <p>I spent 100+ hours in Night City, and I still yearn for more.</p>
